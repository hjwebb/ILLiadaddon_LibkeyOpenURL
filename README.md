# Details
This is the config.xml and openurl.lua file for an altered version of the OpenUrl addon for Atlas' ILLiad product. It searches Libkey first if there is a DOI or PMID. If there isn't, it searches your openurl (in this example it is Primo VE). You can switch between the two searches and open the result window in your default browser.
